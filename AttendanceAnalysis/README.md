Bonus: Attendance Analysis - Do large crowds impact a referee's tendency to overturn a call?

To answer this, I gathered the attendances for each MLS game in the data set from FBref. After that, I also gathered the stadium that each of these games was in, and the max capacity of that stadium. I was then able to find the proportion of the stadium that was filled in addition to the raw attendance. I then compared these values against the “Good for Home” variable that I mentioned earlier. I split the attendance and the “fullness” values into percentile bins (since the distribution of attendances was pretty skewed and I didn’t want to worry about there not being enough data for the extreme values) and then compared each bin to the proportion of “Good for Home” decisions that occurred inside each one. 

The results of this investigation were a little surprising. It appears that referees are actually slightly less likely to give a decision in favor of the home team at stadiums with large attendances. There’s actually a pretty clear split between the “Good for Home” rates at games with an attendance above and below the median. 

The results of this study were why I decided to check the proportion as well. Some teams, such as the ones that play at NFL stadiums, have much higher attendances as a result of the stadium being massive, but don’t get close to filling it. I hypothesized that the fullness of the stadium contributes a meaningful amount to the hostility of the environment, since all the densely concentrated noise is probably more intimidating than a greater number of people that are sparsely populating a large arena. 

The results indicate that this might be the case. I wouldn’t jump to any conclusions based on the fullness graph, but it does look like there’s a possibility that fuller stadiums get slightly more calls in their favor.
